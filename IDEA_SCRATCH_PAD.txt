cool ideas:

when dragging a scale to chord bucket : iterate all possible chords!


problems:
0.) OPTIMIZATION : setSelectedScale method is toooooo slooowwww
2.) layout for menu widget as a child (About us last tab)
3.) DnD to deeply nested 
3.) Omni links - layout bug
5.) Recursive layout on deeply nested widget reference : ie "${PARENT.WIDTH}" [---->${PARENT.WIDTH}<----]  not working > 1 level deep!
6.) create test / example area (of deeply nested widgets and DnD things - ef file manager and drop area)
7.) then finish attributiuons

8.) also add practie session widget (eg - day, content (ie file), duration, table / checklist / timer)
9.) regresssion :set selected key no longer works!!! (fretbord)
19:) regression: file browser breadcrumb no longer works


8.)  fix menu autolayout / resize bug - MENU Widget - (try gutar)
 -- ie resizr a WIDGET menu, the nclick to a text menu .... snap) 
--- also resizing the actual widget allows contents to go out of boundss....

9.) Roll out new "template" eg chord study etc


1.) roll outsetSelectedKey
chord and scale (WidgetMusical)

2.) Roll out 

IDEAS: ---------------------
1.) optimize fretboard, nut and strings into VBO 
2.) Mini 5 fret chord view!! context menu only invoked after rightclicked and dumped / not updated when not vis
how much can be ported ti ios


bug - B5 name not calculated on chords....

Donate ... not donated... 

DONE::::: clicking openstring has stopped working again (actually - even dragging an open string chord doesnt show)


TOMORROW:::::
bug - when large ret range selected -  (and gragging from biggie) chord is rejected : trim range

todo: when browsing up and down - store "original chord" if it doesnt match exactly to prior - 
dont set it again and then when browsing up and down again, atttempt to find the original chord - 
so it does not "continue to morph"  ------> look at embedded chord designet - it accomplished this

dragging chord when a scale is there sometimes does not change mode!!

c5 - doesn't work (when selecting and then unselecting higher 5th - it never reselectes it)

creativity is just the start!

chord bucket area - support pre-rendered fret diagrams


--------------------q
for tomo
-------------------------
change to flat and drag - results in sharp!
changing flat / sharp should "rebind" control
chords table, tunings table, strings table!! range table (ie start stop)
13ths not calculated!! use chord designer ????? methods.....


Basic sequencer (table)
 shows a row for each musical widget which has - isSequenced = true
 channel, instrument, volume

 has BPM

each row ccell has :
chord or scale or key
rythmic patterns

BUG: Chord designer - when selecting 5th interval (1 octave up, it deselects 4th)

// Testers
FRET AND DEGREE TESTER


TODO: 
Element color pass - must use bg for bg and forground for forground - ALL elms
Create a Theme preview widget XML which contails all elements!! (labels, button, sliders, etc) then use for theme preview too!!

use it as a popout from the settings 

----------------------
Textbox prob - scrolling and text cursor backwards
Widget elements set to Zero width disappear and never come back

HARD ones:
Scroll bug - general
Tab func for about screen

... then get started, with instrument picker


calculateMinimum bounds (works by summing....)
set minWidth, height


Problems/Regression after  Scale tweaks

- scale is fine after drop, but "diminishes / warps" when selecting fret ranges
- MUST set chord and scale rules (update UI)
- notes per string and note repetition dont seem to get set to rule after switching from chord to scale
- when loading scale doesnt appear correctly (very likely the same issue as point 1)

see c-major-problem.png

left handed

RESUME : 
1.) update the ui with the rules
TODO: Update Chord rules ui to reflect rules.... ie rules widget L169
Staarting inversion  is always 1!!!
2.) always 1 inversion
4.) 4 notes per string.... rule


usage scenarios:
effortlessly find chord arrangements - disable strings, set fret range, inversions,
enter fingerns manually
explore exotic diatonic chord scales!

open file format

recognize degree patterns in string groups (create excercise)
eg Dm is revers triangle shape biii, V, I (on 3rd)


BUGZ - 

Guitar title - 


Adding points after setting key on fresh guitar not right!!

----------------------------------------------

C4 - results in invalid chord name.....



hover NAMED chord and the ncalculated chord name
the title is not updated!!


-------------------------------------------------

/*
2 probs:
1 - loadstate - extended notes from guitar chord
2 - selecting notes does not use extended notes - revert back!
*/

guitar - to read from value too
chord sub menu of guitar doesnt updte to custom (should update bi-directionally)

add breadcrumbs
show menu on load?


TED GREENE VIBES:
eg - user selects exotic chord from notes, store the points
but if user changes tuning, and the chord is no longer valid, recalculate!!
bizzare - only storing 1st val in xml dnd

// then --- transmit to widget (mouse hover)
// then mini guitar chord diagram

--------- TODO : chord mode on guitar is still defaulting to 4 notes per string!
--------- sync rules ui
--------- chord table!!
---- file browser windows
-------- chord diagrams in the chord bucket

// dragging unknown chord..... (for designer, should still transmit data)
// built in sequencer menu item (chords or freeform)




-------------------------- NEXT -----------------------------------
FIRST : setting the key when dragg (to update menus on guitar - slows things down a LOT) move setKey elsewhere?
---- TODOL saving fretpoints : when changing frets only permit points WITHIN the range!!!
-- display user defined chord name in chord designed, chord bucket
-- chord bucket show real chord shapes from ghuitar
-- update rules menu
-- some scenarios dragging chord to guitar doesnt work!! (from designer)

logic priority:
new property - userEnteredName

when manually selecting points, keep 



if it HAS fretpoints, add them and check the chord namem if it's ok, leave it
if not, go through the regular calculation


ODDITY: dragging guitar data to bass ---- weirdness :)



Scales fret range rules - not working
saved state on a chord apoplies a different rule as opposed to whats been saved in XML (loadState)
(ie if strings are disabled and starting inversion)
Think it's because a rule is out of sync with 


                           <stringed>
                                <notesPerString>1</notesPerString>
                                <searchForExactChordMatch>1</searchForExactChordMatch>
                                <searchForExactChordMatchDirection>up</searchForExactChordMatchDirection>
                            </stringed>

needs to be persisted with the starting inversion!!!                            


1.) Sync loaded XML -> rules widget (ie the UI)
1.5) Clear up the rules names (it move stringed -> general)
2.) sync string range -> rule !! (guitar)
DONE: 3.) bug: changing key on guitar does not update the selected scale correctly!
4.) Drag and drop ONTO scale picker - not responding!!

---> this is causing bugs until done!! Implement syncronization on load with Rules menu
Scale drag and drop rules
Scale and chord picker drag and drop (-> guitar, chord bucket) - rules must be carried over
apply rules persistence for scales....
chord bucket - show correct note inversions / order ....
Fire rules changed when dragged and dropped....
Rename rules correctly to have insrument names... (and move stuff to general - see chord rules widget)
Midi DND data - selectedNotesWithRuleApplied? ?
refactor chord rules widget to show only rules relevent to scenario

persist fret range with scale / chords 
note repetition not working with scales

rename rules properly
move strings etc to rules

DONE: Implement persist and resmusicaltore for SCALES
DONE: rules data from chord bucket isnt working because of slices in bucket
DONE: test dragging guitar to guiatar with riules
DONE: rules in CHORD designer (drag data)

options



MASSIVE BUG:
---------------------
Drag data of guitar is not set correctly when dragging and dropping chords with extended notes (I think it's because of the add chord change - and set data)
Easily fixable, to "re-calculate" just enter "setIsUserDefinedNotes" when dragging!!!!!


---------------------

Tough  bug:
---------------

Guitar fretboard - when loading (auto load), fret range selection 
is gammy, and saving immegiately after loses it's value

This does no thappen if you load manually!

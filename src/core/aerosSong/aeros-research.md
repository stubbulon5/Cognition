TICKS: 192 | OFFSET: 0 [TRACK L: CHASP1T1.wav : 192780 frames] 




Duration(ms)*Sampling rate eg 
4371*44.1 = 192761.1 (frames?)

1.) is it rounded UP (based on ticks ????)

PS. For the record, frame and sample are not equivalent. In audio programming, you might come across the term frame to denote a number of contiguous samples that are processed in one go: it's also known as a block or vector.
